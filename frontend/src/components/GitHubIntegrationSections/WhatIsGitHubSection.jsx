                GitHub was founded in 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath,
                and PJ Hyett. It hosts code using Git, the version control system
                that tracks every change made to a project over time.

                Developers use GitHub to store repositories, propose changes
                through pull requests, review each other's code, and collaborate
                on projects ranging from solo experiments to massive open-source
                software used by millions.
